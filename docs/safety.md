# Safety

This project is for research tooling and personal experimentation. It is not a medical device.

Sleep-time audio must use conservative defaults:

- low maximum volume
- fade in and fade out
- cooldown between cues
- emergency stop
- arousal and motion checks
- no cueing outside a stable REM gate

`muse_tmr.audio.audio_player.AudioCuePlayer` enforces a maximum playback volume, records
the requested and effective volume, carries fade-in/fade-out settings, supports an
emergency stop state, and can append playback outcomes to JSONL logs. Tests must use
mock or dry-run playback rather than a real speaker.

Cue libraries must validate private sound-file availability before a sleep session.
Missing cue files should block the session plan rather than failing after the subject
is asleep.

Do not promise clinical benefit, diagnosis, treatment, or guaranteed lucid dreaming.
