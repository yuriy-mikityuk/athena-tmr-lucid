# Polar H10 companion recording

The Muse heart signal is forehead PPG at 64 Hz, so `ppg_features` labels its
HRV a proxy. A Polar H10 chest strap recorded in the same session adds
beat-level RR, a 130 Hz single-lead ECG and chest acceleration for breathing.
It does nothing for the EEG side. Nothing here feeds REM detection, the gate,
the arousal guard, the scheduler or audio.

Code: `muse_tmr.sources.polar_h10` (BLE, parsing), `muse_tmr.data.polar_recorder`
(recorder, decoder), `muse_tmr.data.polar_session` (alignment, loader),
`muse_tmr.features.cardio_resp_features` (features).

## Setup

- Wet both electrode areas of the strap and wear it just below the chest
  muscles, the H10 logo upright and centred. A dry strap gives HR dropouts and a
  noisy ECG for the first minutes.
- The H10 accepts only a limited number of connections and phones/watches grab
  it. If `record-polar` says the strap is not found, turn off Bluetooth on the
  phone or close the Polar/Strava app, then retry.
- macOS Bluetooth permission (TCC) works the same way as for the Muse: launch
  through the same Terminal or `Python.app` setup that already records the Muse
  (see the BLE notes in `AGENTS.md`). `record --with-polar` starts the Polar
  recorder as a child of the Muse recorder, so it inherits that permission.
- Polar known issue: an H10 that is never told to stop ECG/ACC streaming stays
  on until its battery is empty, even off the strap. The recorder always sends
  the stop commands, including on Ctrl-C / the app's Stop button. If a run is
  ever killed hard (`kill -9`), reconnect once with `record-polar` for a few
  seconds to stop it.

## Commands

```bash
# Muse + H10 together; the H10 runs in its own process
muse-tmr record --source amused --preset p1034 --duration-seconds 600 --allow-short \
  --output-dir data/recordings/session/smoke_h10 --with-polar

# H10 alone into an existing or new session directory
muse-tmr record-polar --output-dir data/recordings/session/<name> --duration-seconds 600 \
  [--address <ble-address>] [--no-ecg] [--acc-rate 50] [--acc-range 2]

# rebuild decoded files from the raw log
muse-tmr decode-polar data/recordings/session/<name>
```

`--with-polar` is fully isolated from the Muse run: a Polar child that crashes,
never finds the strap or exits early only shows up as `companion_*` events in
the Muse `events.jsonl`. The Muse `stop_reason` and summary never depend on it.
At the end the Muse recorder writes its own summary first, then sends the child
SIGINT and waits up to 30 s.

## Files

Everything lands in `<session_dir>/polar/` (under `data/recordings/`, gitignored):

| File | Content |
| ---- | ------- |
| `raw_notifications.jsonl` | Every BLE payload as received plus the control-point commands we sent. See `docs/data_model.md`. |
| `events.jsonl` | recording_started, connected (with stream settings), connect_failed, disconnected, recording_stopped. |
| `clock_anchors.jsonl` | `time.time()` / `time.monotonic()` pairs at start, every 60 s and at stop. |
| `metadata.json` | Device name, model, firmware, negotiated stream settings. No BLE address or serial. |
| `summary.json` | stop_reason, reconnects, downtime, notification counts, decode counts, gaps, errors. |
| `hr_rr.jsonl` | One row per HR notification: receive times, HR, contact bits, RR list (ms). |
| `ecg.jsonl`, `acc.jsonl` | One row per PMD frame: receive times, sensor timestamp, first-sample time, sample period, samples (µV, mG). |

## Time alignment

Muse replay timestamps are host wall-clock, so Polar data is mapped onto the
host wall-clock too.

1. PMD frames carry a sensor timestamp: ns since 2000-01-01Z for the **last**
   sample of the frame (after a power cycle the H10 restarts its clock at
   2019-01-01, which does not matter here). Per-sample times are spread back
   from it using the gap to the previous frame, or the nominal rate after a gap.
2. Sensor time is mapped to host monotonic time with an offset and a linear
   drift fitted to the **lower envelope** of (receive time - sensor time): a
   linear program that keeps every frame on or above the line. BLE only ever
   adds delay, so a least-squares line would sit late by the mean delay. The
   residuals above the line are the BLE delays and are reported
   (`delay_median_ms`, `delay_p95_ms`). An H10 that powers down during a
   reconnect restarts its clock, so frames are split into clock segments
   wherever receive time minus sensor time jumps by more than 30 s, and each
   segment gets its own fit (`clock_segments`).
3. Monotonic is converted to wall-clock through the clock anchors; a jump in
   wall - monotonic between anchors (an NTP step) is reported as `ntp_step_ms`.
4. HR-service RR intervals have no sensor timestamp. With ECG on, each
   notification's RR batch is matched to a run of consecutive ECG R-peaks and
   takes their times (`aligned_to = ecg_r_peak`). With ECG off, beats keep a
   receive-time estimate (`aligned_to = host_receive`) that can be off by up to
   about a second.

Expected error: on synthetic data with 50 ppm drift and random BLE delays the
mapped times are within a few ms of the truth over 8 h. A constant minimum BLE
latency (a few ms, one connection interval) cannot be told apart from a clock
offset and stays in the result as a small fixed lag.

## Features

`extract_cardio_resp_features(session, start, end)` per epoch or block:

- R-peaks on the 130 Hz ECG (5-25 Hz detection band, adaptive threshold),
  refined with a parabola through the apex because raw resolution is ~7.7 ms.
  Device RR vs ECG RR agreement is reported.
- RR correction: a beat is flagged when outside 300-2000 ms or more than 20 %
  away from the median of the surrounding 10 beats; flagged beats are linearly
  interpolated. An ectopic usually flags as a short-long pair. The percent of
  corrected beats is reported.
- Mean HR always; RMSSD, SDNN and pNN50 only for windows of at least 60 s.
- Breathing from chest ACC: 0.05-0.7 Hz band-pass of the first principal
  component, both spectral peak and breath-by-breath median, plus ECG-derived
  respiration from R-amplitude modulation as a cross-check.
- RSA: LF (0.04-0.15 Hz) and HF (0.15-0.4 Hz) RR power, and power in a ±0.03 Hz
  band around the measured breathing frequency. Below about 9 breaths/min the
  RSA sits in LF, so `hf_band_valid` is 0 and HF must not be read as vagal tone.
- Exhale/inhale ratio is not implemented: the sign of the dominant ACC
  component does not say which phase is inhalation without a reference, so the
  ratio could silently come out inverted.

## Limitations

- BLE delay and dropouts, especially with two peripherals on one Mac adapter.
  The first live session must compare Muse frame counts and gaps against a
  Muse-only recording of the same length.
- 130 Hz ECG (±2 % rate) limits raw R-peak timing to ~7.7 ms before
  interpolation.
- ACC respiration breaks down with posture changes, movement and talking;
  breath-by-breath and spectral rates disagreeing is the warning sign.
- The HF band is invalid during slow breathing, see above.
- Not integrated into the meditation analysis yet (#122 follow-up).
